# Rolodex

This code is functionally secure because it is clean, concise, and modular. This code has also been unit-tested, which was made easier from its modular design. The client needed a program where objects could be created, destroyed, have unique attributes, and have the code verified through the creation of a unit test. This program wasn't overly complicated because I try to meet the client's requests in the most efficient way possible.
